What are ACID properties?

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties are a set of principles that ensure the reliability and integrity of database transactions. These properties guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably and securely, even in the presence of failures or concurrent access.

Why are ACID properties useful?

ACID properties are essential for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and security of database transactions. Here are some reasons why ACID properties are useful:

1. Prevents data corruption: ACID properties prevent data corruption by ensuring that transactions are executed as a single, indivisible unit.
2. Ensures data consistency: ACID properties ensure that data remains consistent across the database, even after multiple transactions.
3. Supports concurrent access: ACID properties enable multiple transactions to access the database concurrently, without interfering with each other.
4. Guarantees transaction reliability: ACID properties ensure that transactions are executed reliably, even in the presence of failures or system crashes.
5. Provides auditing and recovery: ACID properties provide a clear audit trail of all transactions, making it easier to recover from failures or errors.

Real-world examples of ACID properties

1. Banking transactions: ACID properties ensure that banking transactions, such as transfers and withdrawals, are executed reliably and securely.
2. E-commerce transactions: ACID properties ensure that e-commerce transactions, such as orders and payments, are executed reliably and securely.
3. Airline reservation systems: ACID properties ensure that airline reservation systems can handle multiple bookings and cancellations concurrently, without errors or inconsistencies.


A - Atomicity
- Ensures that database transactions are treated as a single, indivisible unit.
- Either all changes are made, or none are made.
- Example: When transferring money from one account to another, atomicity ensures that either both accounts are updated, or neither is.

C - Consistency
- Ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, even after multiple transactions.
- Data must conform to the rules and constraints defined in the database.
- Example: If a bank's database requires that account balances be non-negative, consistency ensures that no transaction can result in a negative balance.

I - Isolation
- Ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without interfering with each other.
- Each transaction sees a consistent view of the data, as if it were the only transaction.
- Example: When multiple users are accessing the same database, isolation ensures that one user's transaction doesn't affect another user's transaction.

D - Durability
- Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and survive even in the event of a failure.
- Committed data is safely stored and can be recovered in case of a system crash or power failure.
- Example: When you transfer money from one account to another, durability ensures that the transaction is safely recorded and won't be lost, even if the system crashes.
